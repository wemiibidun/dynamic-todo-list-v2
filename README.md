## Introduction

This project was built as an updated version to the dynamic to-do list that was initially created [here](https://github.com/wemiibidun/dynamic-todo-list) as a beginner-friendly project using vanilla JavaScript. This new version takes a step further with more structure and interactivity. It introduces category-based task types *(Personal, Work, and Study)* using prototypal inheritance, allows users to drag and drop tasks, reorder them, and ensures information remains in the localStorage, so that tasks don't disappear even after a page refresh.
